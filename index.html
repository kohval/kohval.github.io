		<h1>A Man and the Resistance</h1>
		<img src="images/resistance_Image.jpg" alt="An image of the resistance which looks like a small skeleton key.">
		<p1>	There comes a time in a man's life when he has to say enough is enough.
			Those frog faced Enlightened want to change me into something "more" than
			human. Well, I resist. I will make the choice to change or not. I will chose
			my fate and fight to keep safe the choices of others. I chose to make my own
			decision and I have decided that, now, enough is enough.
